Description: Network meta-analyses using Bayesian framework following Dias et al. (2013) <DOI:10.1177/0272989X12458724>. Based on the data input, creates prior, model file, and initial values needed to run models in 'rjags'. Able to handle binomial, normal and multinomial arm-level data. Can handle multi-arm trials and includes methods to incorporate covariate and baseline risk effects. Includes standard diagnostics and visualization tools to evaluate the results.
