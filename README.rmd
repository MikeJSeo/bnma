# bnma (Bayesian network meta analysis)

The package is now publicly available in CRAN. https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bnma. Package is quite similar and has been inspired greatly by the gemtc packge (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gemtc/index.html). Some features that bnma offers:

- gemtc offers binomial, normal, and poisson outcomes; bnma has binomial, normal, and multinomial outcomes.
- bnma adds modelling baseline risk (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.5539)
- bnma automatically checks for convergence using gelman-rubin diagnostics before sampling full iteration amount
- bnma generates reasonable initial values if left unspecified (dispersed initial values)
- bnma has added new summary plots: rank plots, forest plot, etc


Thank you,
