# bnma (Bayesian network meta analysis)

This Package is quite similar and has been inspired greatly by a popular Bayesian NMA package gemtc. Some additional features of bnma include:

- bnma has binomial, normal, and multinomial outcomes.
- bnma adds modelling baseline risk
- bnma automatically checks for convergence using gelman-rubin diagnostics before sampling full iteration amount
- bnma generates reasonable initial values if left unspecified (dispersed initial values)
- bnma adds an option to report relative risk and risk difference (instead of the usual odds ratio) using external placebo event rate for binomial outcome
- bnma adds new summary plots: rank plots, forest plot, etc

Please see the vignette for detailed examples of using this package.
