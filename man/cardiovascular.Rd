\description{
A dataset of 17 studies investigating dosage of statin for cardiovascular disease.
There are two treatments and a placebo. High dose statin is coded as 3, low dose statin as 2, and placebo is coded as 1 and treated as a baseline treatment.
Outcomes are reported as three mutually exclusive unordered outcomes.
First column of the outcome is the patients who are still alive (ALIVE). Second column is fatal non-cardiovascular disease (FnCVD).
And, the last column is fatal cardiovascular disease (FCVD).
